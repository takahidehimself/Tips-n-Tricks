Vortex Pok3r on macOS

I've switched places between Left Alt and the Win key, moved FN to Left Ctrl,
moved Right Alt to FN's original position and then placed Left Ctrl at Right Alt's original position.

Make WASD the new IJKL.

My Evoluent VerticalMouse4 takes care of the other hotkeys that I use.
Button 1   - Left Click
Button 2   - Middle Click
Button 3   - Right Click
Button 4   - Forward
Button 5   - Back
Button 6   - Secondary Function
Button 6+1 - Move Left a Space
Button 6+2 - Move Right a Space
Button 6+3 - Show Mission Control
Button 6+4 - Applications

How about Launchpad?
Applications normally opens Finder>Applications if Finder is active, but I've
setup a shortcut (Button 6+4 becomes Shift-command-A) under
System Preferences>Keyboard>Shortcuts>Launchpad & Dock>Show Launchpad which
takes presedence whatever window you click in.
